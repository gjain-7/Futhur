A career counselling project 

Problem statement : To solve the multifaceted issue of career choice and the associated harms of an unplanned career

Project idea : A web based application that rank orders a set of careers based on the personlity of individual and filters them with IQ scores

Description of project : 
The application is built entirely on python with flask as the host. HTML is also used to design the interface of the web-application.
A multi-layered neural network is built that takes user input in the form of a quiz. This quiz's inputs are feeded into the network that is calliberated with 
predetermined weights that enable the program to give the output in the form of a list. This list contains the professions that are most suitable to the personality 
of the user. This list is passed through the IQ filter that trims the output list to display only those professions that the user is capable of.

Challenges Faced :
The whole project was a great learning experience for the both of us. Some challenges we faced were that we had no idea how to create a gui for our program.
We chose flask so that we could deploy it on a browser. We had to use a slight amout of html in the code. For that we managed to learn the barebones of the html syntax.
Moreover there we lots of bugs that we encounterd throughout our program. Most of them were type errors. We also had errors like sys admin errors. Initaily we thought that 
due to python not being installed properly on the system, it was causing permission errors. We tried reinstalling python, VS code and all the libraries to try and solve that.
We later realized that it was a file handling issue that was easily resolved by using dyanmic path code.
The time crunch was probably the biggest challenge we faced. We have been working non-stop with only nutrition breaks for the last 24 hours. The goal we had set was 
momentous and we are quite proud of what we could achieve in this short timeframe.
